Please create a Rust program that implements a tiny basic interpreter. 
The language should support arithmetic expressions, variables, and control flow statements.
The interpreter should be able to execute a program written in this language.  
The interpreter should be limited to integer arithmetic and should support the following commands:

PRINT	Print a comma separated list of values, and string constants in quotes.
LET	Assign a value to a variable
GOTO	Jump to a line number
IF	Conditional jump
END	End of program

Variables are single letters A-Z and are initialized to 0.
DIM	Declare an array with a given size and name A-Z

LOAD to load a program from a file
SAVE to save a program to a file
RUN to run the program
LIST to list the program
NEW to clear the program
QUIT to quit the interpreter
